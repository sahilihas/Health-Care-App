# Health-Care-App

The Health Care and Appointment Management App is a mobile application developed using OutSystems, a low-code development platform. This app aims to streamline the process of managing healthcare appointments for both patients and healthcare providers. With this app, users can easily schedule, view, and manage their appointments, improving efficiency and enhancing the overall patient experience.

Features

Appointment Scheduling Patients can schedule appointments with healthcare providers based on their availability. Healthcare providers can manage their availability and view their upcoming appointments. The app provides a user-friendly calendar interface for selecting appointment dates and times. Appointment Reminders Users receive timely reminders and notifications about their upcoming appointments. Reminders can be customized based on user preferences (e.g., email, push notifications). Patient Profiles Patients can create and manage their profiles, including personal information, medical history, and insurance details. Healthcare providers can access patient profiles to have a comprehensive view of their patients' information. Search and Find Healthcare Providers Users can search for healthcare providers based on various criteria such as specialization, location, and ratings. The app provides a comprehensive directory of healthcare providers, making it easier for patients to find the right healthcare professional. Appointment History and Tracking Patients can view their appointment history, including past and upcoming appointments. Healthcare providers can access patient appointment history for reference and tracking purposes. Integration with Electronic Health Records (EHR) The app can integrate with existing Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems to fetch and display patient information securely. This integration ensures that healthcare providers have access to up-to-date patient data during appointments. Installation and Configuration Clone the repository to your local machine.
